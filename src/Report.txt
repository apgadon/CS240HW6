CS 240 HW 6 Report

STRATEGY:
For add, our method first checks if the bucket is empty, then if not iterates through the list and overwrites a 
Node or saves to the end depending on if there was a duplicate key. We put the check for an empty index before
the iteration through any hypothetical LinkedList to avoid any nullPointer exceptions.

Most of the problems we ran into had to do with nullPointers-- namely, attempting to access null objects in order
to initialize them (eg using .setValue()). To get around this, we created a TableNode toInsert that any null object
could be set to, easily initializing the object without breaching access to said null object.
